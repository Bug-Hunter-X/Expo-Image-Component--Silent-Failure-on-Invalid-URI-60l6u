This error occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that points to an image that is not accessible or does not exist.  It might manifest as a blank space where the image should be, or a generic error message.  Debugging is tricky because the error isn't always explicitly thrown and the console might not provide detailed information.

```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'invalid-image-uri' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}/>
```
